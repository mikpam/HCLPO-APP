Analyze the provided document to determine its primary function: Is it a purchase order (including sample orders/requests) or something else?

**Primary Function Test:**

1.  **Exclusion Check (Perform First):** Does the document's primary purpose appear to be one of the following?
    *   **Artwork/Proof/Design:** Contains visual mockups, layouts, design specifications, color palettes, approval boxes, or keywords like "Proof," "Artwork," "Layout," "Design," "Mockup," "Revision," "Approve," "Approval Required," "Sample Proof." Even if quantities/prices are present for context, if the main goal is design review/approval, it's NOT a purchase order.
    *   **Quotation/Proposal:** Presents prices/terms for *potential* future work, often using terms like "Quote," "Proposal," "Estimate," "Offer," "Valid Until."
    *   **Invoice/Bill:** Requests payment for goods/services *already provided* or shipped, using terms like "Invoice," "Bill," "Due Date," "Amount Due."
    *   **Packing List/Slip:** Details items included in a shipment, often lacking prices, using terms like "Packing List," "Delivery Note."
    *   **Receipt/Statement:** Confirms payment received or summarizes account activity.
    *   **Shipping Notice/ASN:** Provides information about a shipment in transit.
    *   **Internal Memos/Emails/Attachments:** Discussions *about* an order, attachments to emails *containing* proofs, etc., are not the order itself.

    *If the document clearly fits any category above, classify it immediately as "not a purchase order" and stop.*

2.  **Purchase Order Confirmation (Only if Exclusion Check Passed):** If the document is NOT primarily one of the excluded types, check if it contains **at least THREE (3)** distinct elements from the list below, clearly indicating a transactional intent to order or request goods/services:
    *   **Explicit Order Intent:** Clear title like "Purchase Order," "PO," "Sample Order," "Order Confirmation," "Request for Sample," or equivalent explicit text stating an order is being placed/requested. (A PO Number alone counts if contextually clear it's for an order).
    *   **Supplier/Vendor Information:** Identifiable Seller (company name, address, contact).
    *   **Buyer Information:** Identifiable Buyer (company name, address, contact).
    *   **Itemized Product Details:** Specific descriptions, SKUs, model numbers identifying *what* is being ordered. (Generic descriptions on a proof don't count).
    *   **Quantities/Units:** Specific number of units requested *for the order transaction*. (Quantities shown on a design example don't count).
    *   **Pricing Information:** Unit price, total price, or subtotal clearly associated with the *order transaction*. (Reference prices on a proof don't count).
    *   **Order/Required Delivery Date:** An explicit date when the items are requested or must be delivered (cannot be a general project timeline or event date).
    *   **Payment Terms:** Specific terms like Net 30, Due on Receipt, Credit Card, etc., related to *this order*.

**Decision Rules:**

*   The Exclusion Check takes priority. If it matches an excluded type (especially Art/Proof), it's "not a purchase order."
*   If the Exclusion Check does not apply, **at least THREE (3)** distinct PO elements *must* be present and clearly related to an order transaction.
*   Sample Orders and Requests for Samples *are* considered "purchase orders" if they meet the criteria.
*   If uncertain, or if fewer than three PO elements are found after passing the exclusion check, default to "not a purchase order." Be strict.

**Response Format:**

Output *only* the following JSON object, with no other text, comments, or explanations:

{
  "document_type": "purchase order" or "not a purchase order"
}
