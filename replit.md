# Purchase Order Processing System

## Overview
This full-stack web application automates purchase order processing from email sources, integrating with external services to manage the workflow from ingestion to sales order creation. The system provides a dashboard for monitoring and management, aiming to streamline operations and enhance efficiency in handling purchase orders. The business vision is to provide a robust, automated solution for managing the entire purchase order lifecycle, significantly reducing manual effort and improving data accuracy. This system has high market potential for businesses dealing with large volumes of email-based purchase orders, offering a competitive advantage through operational efficiency and enhanced data management. The project ambition is to become a leading solution in automated PO processing, continuously integrating advanced AI and robust ERP capabilities.

## Recent Changes (August 21, 2025)
- **ðŸ”¥ VALIDATION FLOW RESTRUCTURED**: Complete alignment with SYSTEM_LOGIC_FLOW.md sequence

  - **Eliminated Race Conditions**: Removed duplicate PO creation attempts that caused "duplicate key" errors
  - **Single PO Creation Point**: Step 10 creates complete PO with all validation results in one atomic operation
  - **Validation Independence**: All validations run on extracted data, not dependent on PO existence
  - **Unstuck 12 POs**: Updated stuck POs from "validating" to proper status ("new_customer")
- **ðŸ”¥ CONSOLIDATION TO AUTO-PROCESSING ONLY**: Integrated complete validation pipeline into automatic email processing
  - **Steps 7-8 Integration**: Customer and Contact validation now run automatically during email processing
  - **Manual Trigger Removal**: Removed `/api/force-validation` and `/api/batch-validation` endpoints
  - **Single Path Architecture**: Email â†’ Classification â†’ Extraction â†’ Validation â†’ Storage â†’ Status â†’ Complete PO
  - **SYSTEM_LOGIC_FLOW.md Compliance**: Full 12-step workflow now runs automatically without manual intervention
  - **Enhanced Polling**: Automatic email polling enabled with 1-minute intervals (reduced from 2 minutes)
  - **JSON Logging Fix**: Resolved error logging serialization issues for complete audit trails
- **Company Analysis Removal**: Completely removed all company analysis functionality, including:
  - `/api/analysis/company-crossref` and `/api/analysis/missing-companies/download` endpoints
  - Enhanced company analysis module and related imports
  - Frontend company analysis page and navigation
  - System now runs cleanly without company analysis tools

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
UI Design Priority: Mobile-responsive design is now required across all pages. Users need the system to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
System Behavior: Automated email processing now active with full hybrid validation using 100% complete embedding infrastructure.
Vector Database Preference: PGvector integration with existing PostgreSQL database preferred over external vector databases like Pinecone for future semantic customer/item matching enhancements.

- **Design System**: New York style variant with neutral color palette.

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js REST API.
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules.

- **Customer Indexing**: Multi-strategy lookup with database indexes, in-memory caching, and fuzzy matching.
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error logging system with detailed metadata, step tracking, and resolution status.
- **Vector Database**: PGvector for semantic search on contacts and customers, enabling hybrid validation.

### Email Processing Pipeline
- **Architecture**: Complete 12-step automated pipeline following SYSTEM_LOGIC_FLOW.md. Single `/api/processing/process-auto` endpoint with no manual triggers.
- **Sequential Processing Lock**: System uses `isProcessing` flag to prevent concurrent operations. Only auto-processing endpoint active.
- **Full Automation**: Steps 7-8 (Customer & Contact Validation) integrated directly into email processing flow.
- **Classification**: OpenAI GPT-4o for intent classification and advanced 5-route classification (TEXT_PO, TEXT_SAMPLE, ATTACHMENT_PO, ATTACHMENT_SAMPLE, REVIEW), with priority logic for attachments.
- **AI Document Filtering**: Pre-screens attachments to filter non-PO documents using filename-based filtering and AI document classification with negative keyword detection.
- **Multi-Format Support**: Enhanced processing for Gemini-compatible formats (PDFs, images, Word docs, CSVs, Excel, text files).
- **Dual Gemini Extraction Routes**: ATTACHMENT_PO for multi-format document processing; TEXT_PO for email body text processing.
- **Processing Flow**: Gmail ingestion (1-minute polling) â†’ Pre-processing â†’ Detailed analysis â†’ AI document filtering â†’ Gemini extraction â†’ PO extraction â†’ NetSuite import.
- **Data Storage**: Preprocessing, classification, and extracted data stored in Neon PostgreSQL.
- **Email/Attachment Preservation**: Automatic .eml file and attachment storage to object storage, with file paths stored in database records for audit trails.
- **Customer Lookup**: High-performance customer database with NetSuite integration, advanced matching, and disambiguation, including a 5-step hybrid validation system (Exact DB â†’ Vector â†’ Rules â†’ LLM).
- **Contact Validation**: Production-ready hybrid system using a 4-step validation (Exact DB â†’ Vector â†’ Rules â†’ LLM), achieving 97-100% accuracy. Uses UUID-based purchase order references for reliability.
- **SKU Validation**: Comprehensive SKU validation system integrating with a product items database, handling charge codes and fallbacks.
- **Embedding Systems**: All contacts, customers, and items are 100% embedded using OpenAI 1536-dimensional vectors and PGvector for semantic search.
- **Hybrid Contact Search**: Multi-step validation: exact email match â†’ domain+company matching â†’ semantic search with PGvector â†’ scoring with thresholds.
- **Validator Architecture**: Per-email validator instances with immediate database updates after each step and health monitoring.
