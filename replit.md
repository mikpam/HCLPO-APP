# Purchase Order Processing System

## Overview
This full-stack web application automates purchase order processing from email sources, integrating with external services to manage the workflow from ingestion to sales order creation. The system provides a dashboard for monitoring and management, aiming to streamline operations and enhance efficiency in handling purchase orders.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
UI Design Priority: Mobile-responsive design is now required across all pages. Users need the system to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
System Behavior: Automated email processing should start immediately when server launches without manual prompting.
